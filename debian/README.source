ArrayFire for Debian

DFSG cleaning
-------------

Since version 3.1.0, ArrayFire has been shipping source code with patented 
algorithms. Upstream has been kind enough to name the corresponding source 
files with a *nonfree* suffix. As a result, running the following command:

  find -name *nonfree* -type f -delete

after merging a new upstream tag should be enough to perform DFSG cleaning.
